Contains MatLab code for a model that tracks the Earth's climate for 60 million years while the greenhouse gas levels decrease to see if there is a potential correlation between a greenhouse gas decrease and a Snowball Earth scenario - one where the Earth achieves energy equilbirium in a state where it is frozen solid.
